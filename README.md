# This Poem Opposes Genocide
A code-poem by Claire James Carroll, published as a Letter to the Editor between Re•mediate Issues•3 and •4.

## Process Note from Claire James Carroll: 
I wrote this poem myself, with the use of a Macbook, an HP external monitor, and a Brave browser. I consulted news and government websites to help gather information and coding education forums such as reddit and W3 schools to help me with python syntax. The script is targeted at American and British readers specifically because I consider both of those places home. I did not use generative AI because I wanted to make all the scripting decisions and because I did not want the work to feed AI training, considering its current use in Gaza. I used Google Docs at various points in the process, which I wish I had more consciously avoided considering the company’s support of Netanyahu’s PR campaigns.

I wanted to critique AI’s contribution to decision making in military scenarios and the imagined 'absolution' or 'randomness' that these systems perpetuate. ‘This Poem Opposes Genocide’ includes several pseudo-random choice commands to set the tone of the generated letter, but I explicitly removed options for a mood of generous since that no longer feels viable. Additionally, the randomizer has been seeded with the years of the Nakba and the three intifadas, which should result in the choice always returning angry. This is not an attempt to invalidate other emotional responses, but rather an attempt to contextualize that none of this is random.

The names of the dead in the infants array come from a dataset hosted by the [Tech for Palestine](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/killed-in-gaza/) collective, ‘Killed in Gaza.' I wanted the array to be visually striking and thus sought a fixed line length. I wrote a small script to help with string length counting, but otherwise sorted them manually. I am still not sure if this was the best method or the most respectful process.
